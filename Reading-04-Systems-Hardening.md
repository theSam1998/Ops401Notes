## What are three benefits of following CIS Benchmarks?
	- CIS Benchmarks provide a valuable reference point you can use to ensure your systems are configured to the highest security standard, or at least the baseline established for use by the tech industry as a whole. This prevents the feeling of "guessing" your level of security, as you can simply ensure that your configurations line up with these benchmarks, and then streamline or fortify certain areas according to the needs of your business.
    - CIS Benchmarks are a way of preventing "survivorship bias" in the tech industry. The use of a common set of standards for secure configuration ensures that you can establish a set of consistent configurations across the board, allowing you to focus resources and energy on strengthening your more vulnerable areas rather than continuously needing to pick and hunt for the source of an attack or outage. 
    - CIS Benchmarks will allow other businesses to measure your security configurations according to the same set of standards you've used to set them up. Properly and Consistently adhering to CIS benchmarks will show other companies, whether they be potential clients or companies that have a service we wish to use, that you are not a liability to work with and that your security configurations meet industry standards and will not have a high likelihood of failure, outage or a leak/attack occurring. 
        - ðŸ¤–: Reference for Security Configuration: Your point about CIS Benchmarks serving as a reference is spot-on. They help organizations avoid the pitfalls of ad hoc security configurations, thereby reducing vulnerabilities.
        - ðŸ¤–: Preventing Survivorship Bias: The emphasis on consistent standards to focus on vulnerabilities is crucial. CIS Benchmarks help in uniform security enhancement across all systems.
        - ðŸ¤–: Standard for Measuring Security: Indeed, adherence to these benchmarks can boost a company's reputation in security assurance, facilitating smoother collaborations and partnerships.
            - ðŸ¤–: They also help in streamlining compliance processes, as many of these benchmarks are aligned with regulatory requirements, reducing the burden of compliance checks.
## What are the seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks?
- Each of the seven core categories is a comprehensive set of best practices that corresponds to the class of the device mentioned in each category's name;
	- Operating System Benchmarks: These cover your standard day to day desktop operating systems; Windows, Linux, Mac, and their relatives. As a result, the benchmarks included are all standard desktop security configuration guidelines, outlining things like access control, user profile setup and management, driver installation protocols, file system security, monitoring and patch management.
	- Server Software Benchmarks: These cover the ideal security and storage configurations for server software and operating systems from the ground up, allowing you to easily analyze the security status of everything from the OS to the services it's hosting. Server operating systems are operating systems specialized for the needs of running a server, and server software is the software running on those operating systems to perform those duties. The former includes things like Windows Server and Ubuntu Server, and the latter includes things like Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Docker and many more. This set of benchmarks reaches across all server processes, including server admin controls, vNetwork policies, and PKI certificates among others.
	- Cloud Provider Benchmarks: you can see we are on a trend of things corresponding to their namesakes by this point; these ones cover broad reaching security configurations for your cloud hosted services and their management portals; think AWS, Azure, GCP, the like. Everything about access control management, logging protocols, secure network configuration and cloud GRC is covered here.
	- Mobile Device Benchmarks: Cover your mobile phones, tablets, etc. Devices running mobile OS's can be secured according to these benchmarks, covering things like dev control access, privacy configurations, web security settings, permissions, and more.
	- Network Device Benchmarks: Routers, smart switches, hardware that serves a networking purpose is covered here. These include elements of both hardware configuration and GRC, as in network security employee training and having proper network security policies and AUPs implemented is just as important as any firewall for ensuring security of your system. Things like network ACLs, firewall rule configurations, network security policy guidelines and standards for updating firmware and software are all covered here among many others.
	- Desktop Software Benchmarks: These cover security configurations for all your desktop software; while Server Benchmarks cover both the server OS and the programs that run on them, this set of benchmarks is more focused on your day to day, most frequently used applications. the Microsoft Office suite, Google chrome, thunderbird; think productivity software. If it's a program you use to get work done or communicate with your coworkers, it's likely covered here.
	- Multi-Function Print Device Benchmarks: These cover multi function printers, a powerful IoT device that can be a serious attack vector if configured insecurely. These benchmarks cover a mix of networking and hardware configuration standards, as well as things like user mannagement/access control and file sharing; being connected to so many systems, you can see why it is vital to secure your multi-function printers.
        - ðŸ¤–: Enhancing the seven CIS Benchmark categories, consider detailing operational specifics. For instance, Operating System Benchmarks focus extensively on access control and user privilege management. Server Software Benchmarks delve deeper into securing server applications. Cloud Provider Benchmarks address cloud-specific security issues. Mobile Device Benchmarks emphasize data protection, while Network Device Benchmarks focus on intrusion detection and security policies. Desktop Software Benchmarks cover application security, and Multi-Function Print Device Benchmarks highlight the importance of network interface and data storage security.
## How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organizationâ€™s compliance?
	-: CIS Benchmarks are designed to map to regulatory frameworks on a global scale, from NIST to HIPAA to GDPR. Whether we are looking at EU or US standards, in any sector, adhering to CIS benchmarks will allow us to consistently ensure a solid baseline for regulatory compliance. At best, they give us an easy starting point to pass other audits, at worst they serve as an excellent starting point for secure system configuration. And, if the budget allows for it, we could potentially purchase CIS hardened images to use in our cloud environments when we need new instances, saving us the time that would normally go into configuring new instances to meet regulatory guidelines.
        - ðŸ¤–: Your approach to advocating CIS Benchmarks for compliance is pragmatic and well-reasoned. By focusing on their alignment with global standards and the practicality of CIS-hardened cloud images, you effectively communicate the dual benefits of enhanced security and streamlined compliance. Highlighting these aspects can persuasively demonstrate the strategic value of CIS Benchmarks in both security and regulatory adherence, making a compelling case to management.
