# Summary of Key Findings:
     - security and risk management is the first of eight domains on the CISSP exam. The subdomains for this domain were last updated in 2021, and center around concepts of managing and protecting digital information, actively preventing risks, compliance with rules and regulations, and continuous improvement of security measures.
    - In security management, the approach of "strategy leading to tactics, and tactics leading to operations" involves setting long-term strategic goals (like centralizing domain control and improving network security), mid-term tactical goals (such as network segmentation and centralizing workstation control), and short-term operational goals (daily tasks for maintaining operational efficiency). This hierarchical planning ensures a structured progression in enhancing security infrastructure, where each level of goal supports and builds upon the other.
    - The planning horizon is  a concept that encompasses the above. Strategic goals define the long term vision, such as revamping your network security. Tactical goals are mid term objectives, the means to your end; revamping your network security requires implementing new security systems. Operational goals cover day to day tasks required to function and grow. This tiered structure allows an often overwhelming and complex objective or task to be broken down into reasonable pieces, ensuring immediate actions align with broader plans for effective security enhancement. 

    - SCRM (Supply Chain Risk Management): This refers to the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks throughout the supply chain. In the context of information security, it involves ensuring that all parts of the supply chain are secure to prevent security breaches, data leaks, or other vulnerabilities that could arise from suppliers or partners. SCRM is focused on maintaining the integrity and security of the supply chain in a holistic manner.
        - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the first domain of the CISSP exam, emphasizing the importance of strategic, tactical, and operational planning in security and risk management. It's important to note that these concepts are not static and should be regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to new threats and technologies in cybersecurity. Furthermore, the inclusion of SCRM highlights the growing recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, a trend that has become more prominent with the increase in sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting supply chains.

## Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
    - confidentiality: One thing that immediately comes to mind for confidentiality is receipts; if receipts are displayed on screen, they should not contain any sensitive information like routing numbers, etc. of course and it would be an excellent practice for the machine to be programmed to automatically remove the receipt from the screen after about 6 seconds. Possibly a function as well to allow a cutter to clip the remainder of the receipt if the user chose to have a paper receipt printed, so that if they walk away it simply drops into a small locked compartment. Another good practice would be a privacy screen. A user of an ATM is going to be staring at it dead on, nobody needs to be able to see the screen from the sides.

    - integrity: SSL/TLS encryption would allow for data security by ensuring that the information received by the user is the same information represented in the bank's database, and has not been tampered with or accessed by a third party.

    - availability: An attack method I have seen documented extensively on ATMs is the use of fake card readers and even pin pads inserted into the machine by malicious actors; this could be addressed by the inherent design of the machine. making the device from a smooth two piece construction with hinges to allow for maintenance access and a strong lock would leave minimal openings, especially if porting was minimal/oddly shaped to make these malicious impersonators difficult or impossible to implement, or at the very least be obviously apparent to users.  
        - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: The measures suggested for the ATM are well-thought-out and align with the principles of the CIA triad. For confidentiality, additional measures such as end-to-end encryption of data transmission and multi-factor authentication can further secure user data. For integrity, apart from SSL/TLS encryption, regular security audits and intrusion detection systems can be employed to ensure data accuracy and detect any unauthorized changes. For availability, besides the physical design aspects to prevent tampering, having redundant systems and regular maintenance schedules can ensure that the ATM services remain available and reliable.

## Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
    - confidentiality: implement comprehensive training programs to prevent social engineering attacks, including educating employees about security protocols, enforcing separation of duties to limit access to sensitive data, and conducting regular analyses to assess and confront vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. A proper infrastructure of security practices is needed to support this training; without proper media/data sanitization, encryption and strict access controls, it wouldn't make much difference how much you train your staff.

    - integrity: Implementing encryption and access controls, as I mentioned earlier, are excellent integrity best practices. While previously they were mentioned in the context of preventing data leaks, in this context the focus is on their ability to prevent unauthorized changes from being made to sensitive information, files, programs or systems. 

    - availability: I'm going to once again refer to the plethora of examples in the "confidentiality" section; vulnerability assessments and by extension bug hunting are absolutely crucial to keeping your service available consistently. While vulnerability assessments will help you address areas of weakness that are open to external attackers, bug hunters cover the unintentional blunders made by ordinary staff; innocent code that clashes with a script another employee wrote for a different part of the same program somehow, a syntax error in a script that doesn't get called frequently but has a critical function; these kinds of issues can lead to inconsistency or even total unavailability for users. 
        - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: The best practices listed are essential for supporting the CIA triad. To expand, for confidentiality, implementing data minimization principles can further reduce the risk of data exposure. In terms of integrity, regular backup and recovery procedures are crucial for restoring data in case of corruption. For availability, implementing cloud-based solutions can offer scalability and resilience to handle varying loads and potential threats, ensuring continuous service availability.

## What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stageâ€™s main goal or objective?
    - Strategic goals: Strategic goals are the bigger picture. The long-term objective that takes a lot of smaller pieces working in tandem to reach. For example, your company's CEO says "over the next year, I want us to focus on improving network security across the organization". That is your strategic goal.

    - Tactical goals: If the strategic goal is the war, your tactical goals are the battles; You can't just go push the "boost network defenses" button, it hasn't been functional since the early '90s and it's only for emergencies anyways. No, to accomplish your strategic goals you'll need to decide on a set of tasks that address the different network security concerns unique to your organization. Things like creating a DMZ, assigning domains, utilizing firewalls (if you haven't been already, what are you doing??) or addressing privelege creep are all great examples here.

    - Operational goals: These are the tasks a little too small to fit into the former category, but still necessary for the proper functioning and growth of your organization; think patching computers and servers, performing needed maintenence on IoT devices, and addressing individual user support tickets. The little stuff that the end users actually see the most of.

        - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: The stages of the risk management lifecycle are well described. It's important to note that these stages are cyclical and iterative. After operational goals are achieved, it's essential to review and assess the outcomes, feeding insights back into the strategic planning stage. This cyclical process ensures continuous improvement and adaptation of security measures to emerging threats and organizational changes.

# Things I Want to Know More About:
- what are the other domains covered by the CISSP?
    - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: The CISSP certification covers eight domains: 1) Security and Risk Management, 2) Asset Security, 3) Security Architecture and Engineering, 4) Communication and Network Security, 5) Identity and Access Management (IAM), 6) Security Assessment and Testing, 7) Security Operations, and 8) Software Development Security. Each domain addresses different aspects of information security, ranging from protecting assets to developing secure software.

- how do all of these concepts tie into one another to form a cohesive unit?
    - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: These concepts are interconnected, forming a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity. For instance, asset security is foundational to risk management, as identifying and classifying assets is key to assessing risks. Security architecture and engineering provide the technical backbone, while IAM ensures that access to these assets is appropriately managed. Regular security assessments and testing validate the effectiveness of these measures, and security operations involve the ongoing management of these security practices. Finally, software development security ensures that security is integrated into software from the beginning.

- what are some of the less obvious devices built with the CIA triad in mind that we use day to day, and how do they cover the principles of this triad?
    - ðŸ¤–:NoteGPT Input: Less obvious devices include smart home devices, such as thermostats and security cameras. For confidentiality, these devices often use encryption and secure communication protocols. For integrity, they frequently receive firmware updates to address vulnerabilities and ensure accurate functioning. For availability, they are designed with fail-safes and redundancies to remain operational even under adverse conditions. Understanding how these everyday devices incorporate the CIA triad principles can provide insights into the pervasive nature of cybersecurity in our daily lives.
